# Project Setup

This Unity project uses the Vuforia Engine package, which cannot be stored on GitHub because the file size exceeds the 100 MB limit.

## Required Step

Download the Vuforia package file:

com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.7.2.tgz

Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_9yy-wfUGaoVCh4EkFOQm0LSNt3k-XV/view?usp=sharing

Place the file into the following folder before opening the project:

ProjectFolder/Packages/com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.7.2.tgz

Unity will automatically install the package when the project starts.
